import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

Born in 1998, I grew up in Arizona and had a lot of time to explore and create.
I became deeply curious about storytelling and digital media, and through high school
I made a lot of [documentaries and narrative films](https://www.dillerteenawards.org/project/filmmaking-for-good/). It wasn't until college that I learned
about Computer Science and the ways I could use it to solve new and interesting problems. During my time at Brown University, I have taken classes
ranging from Machine Learning and Algorithms,
to Programming Languages and Distributed Computer Systems. Outside of class, I've done a bit of Computational Biology
and Natural Language Processing research, and during my summers I've worked
as a Software Engineer intern at Johnson & Johnson and Amazon. Outside of work, I love to travel, try new coffee, and learn new languages (currently learning Russian).

Currently I'm working on a mobile app called [Emit](https://www.getemit.com), and this August I will be joining Amazon Web Services as a Software Development Engineer in Boston,
working on distributed file storage at Elastic File System.
