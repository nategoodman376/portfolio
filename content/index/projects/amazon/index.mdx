Designed and implemented as Java-based CLI that injects periodic
faults into Elastic File System resources in order to improve and build confidence
in its resilience. Developed a novel approach to scheduling automatic attacks using
AWS Maintenance Windows. Leveraged SSM and EC2 APIs to initiate CPU, Disk, VM and Network
Latency attacks in groups of EC2 instances concurrently. Used IText, AWS CloudWatch,
and internal ticketing APIs to auto-generate a PDF report detailing potential
vulnerabilities.
