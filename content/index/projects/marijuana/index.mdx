Currently working under the supervision of the Sloman Lab and AI Lab at Brown University
to examine temporal trends in discourse about marijuana legalization on Reddit from 2008 until 2019.
Built a stance detection model as a feed-forward layer using Tensorflow to predict whether a given post is pro/neutral legalization.
Augmented the model to include configurable input such as author, subreddit, and LDA topic information. Abstracts accepted to ICT 2021 and CogSci 2021
