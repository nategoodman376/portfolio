Used Go to implement the [Raft](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/raft-atc14) protocol; uses passive replication to maintain a consistent log for a cluster.
Implemented leader election, log replication, and core functionality for all three node states (leader, follower, and candidate). Implemented the Chandy-Lamport algorithm to provide distributed snapshots of nodes' logs, state machines, and events that transpired in the system as part of Senior Capstone.
